**Accommodation page** 

To make the icon on the accordions change from a plus to a minus when expanding the accordions, I found a solution on this page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19024218/bootstrap-3-collapse-change-chevron-icon-on-click/ 

Carousel: I realise having different carousels for different screen sizes is not ideal as the code is repetitive.
However, I looked for a solution that would allow the carousel only scroll by one each with each scroll, and adjust to smaller screens to only show one image at a time. But all the solutions I found online required 
javascript and in testing them, they did not work as I wanted my carousel to work. Therefore I have created two carousels, one that will display for mobile devices and one 
that will display for desktops. One of the solutions I considered is here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20007610/bootstrap-carousel-multiple-frames-at-once
